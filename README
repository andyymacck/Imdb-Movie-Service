I have combined the backend Spring Boot with front end React UI from the codeacademy youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ.
I managed to override the CORS error that many people had issues with in the comments, while making some stylistic and minor functional changes to this code,
and am continuing my work in developing more creative additional features.
